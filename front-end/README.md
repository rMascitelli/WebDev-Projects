- Index JS and CSS files for first React app
- Created using create-react-app, useful for spinning up a front-end quickly

- Just replace all files in create-react-app src/ file with these files, and run using npm
- This is just a basic template for the "Airport App" I want to make
- Simply adds and removes some hard-coded flight info
